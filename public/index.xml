      <description>Overview: This notebook aimed is to demonstrate the solution for simple regression problem, predict net profit given a set of attributes, first I start with simple EDA understand the data numerical and categorical distributions. Then I fit simple statistical model followed by linear regression and more complex one. each model includes scoring metrics and explanations. Finally, I communicate final finding of prediction of the provided Out-of-sample test set and the including factors or attributes that decided the final predictions using shapley values.</description>
